- **Theme File Change**:
  - Changed theme persistence file from `theme.json` to `app.json` for better app-specific configuration.

  - Updated button styles for Image/Video mode to reflect active/inactive states with theme-aware colors.
  - Adjusted window centering logic to account for updated UI components.
  - Improved popup window positioning to center relative to the main window.

- **Update Mechanism**:
  - Changed update process to download the `.exe` file directly to the user's Downloads folder and auto-run it, instead of opening the GitHub release page in a browser.
  - Added validation to ensure an `.exe` asset exists in the latest GitHub release before attempting download.

- **Conversion Logic**:
  - Integrated video cropping functionality into the video conversion workflow, allowing users to specify start and end times.
  - Improved error handling for invalid crop time inputs by allowing optional inputs and using defaults when invalid.

  - Updated drag-and-drop and browse functionality to provide more specific error messages for invalid files.

- **Splash Screen**:
  - Ensured splash screen uses `resource_path` for consistent logo loading across development and PyInstaller environments.

### Fixed

  - Fixed theme application to consistently update Image/Video mode buttons' appearance when toggling themes.
  - Ensured progress bars and sliders adopt theme colors correctly using `ttk.Style` configurations.

- **Icon Loading**:
  - Removed redundant icon loading code in `__init__` to prevent duplicate attempts and potential errors.

  - Fixed memory leaks in preview window by properly storing and referencing image objects.
  - Improved error handling for unsupported file types or corrupted media during preview.

- **Update Checker**:
  - Added checks for GitHub server availability to prevent crashes when the server is down.

### Removed
- **Webbrowser Dependency**:
  - Removed `webbrowser` import as the update mechanism no longer opens the GitHub release page in a browser.

- **Old Mode Selection**:
  - Removed radio button-based mode selection in favor of button-based mode switching.
