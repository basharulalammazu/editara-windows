### Added

- **Resizing Capabilities**:
  - Added support for resizing images and videos by width, height, or both.
  - Integrated input validation for numeric resize fields in the UI.
- **Splash Screen**:
  - Implemented a 2-second startup splash screen featuring `logo.png` or fallback text ("Loading...").
- **Theme Persistence**:
  - Theme preferences (light/dark) are now saved in `theme.json` and persist across sessions.
- **File Type Detection**:
  - Added logic to track and validate selected file types based on the active mode.
- **Improved Update Checker**:
  - Enhanced update mechanism to detect all GitHub releases, including pre-releases.
  - Added internet and GitHub connectivity checks before fetching release data.
- **New Dependencies**:
  - Integrated `moviepy` for video processing.
  - Added `packaging` for semantic version comparisons.

### Changed
- **Versioning**:
  - Promoted from `1.0.0 (Pre-release)` to stable `1.0.0`.
- **User Interface**:
  - Updated window title to **üñºÔ∏è Image Format Converter**.
  - Increased default window size to `600x600` and set minimum size to `550x550`.
  - Renamed conversion button from "üöÄ Convert Images" to a mode-agnostic "üöÄ Convert".
  - Format dropdown now updates dynamically based on selected conversion mode.
  - Updated drag-and-drop instructions to reflect support for both image and video files.

- **About Dialog**:
  - Updated GitHub profile link to [github.com/basharulalammazu](https://github.com/basharulalammazu).

  - Integrated resizing functionality into both image and video conversion workflows.

### Fixed
